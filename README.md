# Universe-Unveiled

Hi, I am Paul.

I want to create an Open World game with Pygame. (I don't know if this is a good idea, but I will find out on my journey.)

The game should be about space exploration, planet exploration, mining, base building, crafting, factions, weapons and probably stealth. It should also have some kind of storyline and side missions like bounty hunts and deliveries.

We will see how this will go on.
